📝 **Letter Collection Program**

This project is a simple web app that continuously collects letters from the user through prompts. The user can input characters until they click the "Cancel" button. The app will display the concatenated string of all letters entered by the user. If the user enters anything other than letters (like numbers or special characters), an alert will notify them, and the app will continue asking for input until canceled.

🛠 **Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, String Handling)

📁 **Project Structure:**

- **index.html**: The basic structure of the webpage, including a div to display the collected letters and a link to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **style.css**: Contains the styling for the main container and text, making the webpage visually appealing.
- **script.js**: Includes JavaScript logic to:
  - Continuously prompt the user for input until they click "Cancel".
  - Validate that the input consists only of letters, using a regular expression.
  - Display the concatenated letters in the HTML when the user cancels the input.

⚡ **Features:**

- Continuously prompts the user for letters until "Cancel" is clicked.
- Alerts the user if non-letter characters (numbers, symbols) are entered.
- Displays the collected letters in a clean and readable format once the user cancels the input.
- Stylish layout with centered text and a responsive design.

🚀 **How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the **index.html** file in your browser.
3. Start entering letters, and the program will continuously collect them until you hit the "Cancel" button.
4. Non-letter characters will trigger an alert, and the process will continue.

This is a great project for learning about handling user input, validating data with regular expressions, and interacting with the DOM.
